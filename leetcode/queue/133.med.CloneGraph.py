    Time Complexity: O(N+M) where N is a number of nodes (vertices) and M is a number of edges.
    Space Complexity: O(N). This space is occupied by the visited hash map and in addition to that, space would also be occupied by the recursion stack since we are adopting a recursive approach here. The space occupied by the recursion stack would be equal to O(H) where H is the height of the graph. Overall, the space complexity would be O(N).
